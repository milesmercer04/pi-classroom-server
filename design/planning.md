## Student Interface - Draft 0

### 1. User Stories (student perspective)
#### Lecture Mode
- As a student, I want my screen to mirror the screen to mirror the teacher's so I can get a close look at the materials.
- As a student, I want to navigate backward through slides so I can review if I fall behind.
- As a student, I want to return to the current slide after review so I can rejoin the lecture.

#### Challenge Mode
- As a student, I want to see instructions while I work on a challenge.
- As a student, I want to write code and see results side-by-side.
- As a student, I want to decide when to move to the next challenge so I don't feel rushed.
- As a student, I want to request help so the teacher knows I'm stuck and where.
